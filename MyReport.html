    <p>A computer generated grammar quiz based on the book {{ book }}. You need to read the questions and insert the correct punctuation and capital letters.</p>
    <p>My computer program isn't very good, so please can you give this an adult first to check that the answers are correct. Errors to look out for
    <ul>
        <li>A lot of quotes  books are more than one sentence long, the program only extracts the first or last sentence so you'll need to add the opening/closing quotation mark</li>
        <li>The books I'm searching quite often use a — instead of a comma, but in other cases a — is the correct punctuation, please check each case</li>
        <li>Some of the answers start with a full stop. Ignore this</li>
        <li>Some of the books contain errors, so strange numbers may appear in the answers</li>
    </ul>
